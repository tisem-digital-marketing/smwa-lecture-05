# The Influencer Market 

**Stylized Facts**:

* Large and growing, approx 9.7 billion USD in 2020
  * 2016: 1.7 billion USD, 2025: (expected) > 20 billion USD

* Approx. 3/4 companies use influencer marketing to some extent, mainly Instagram
  * Only 65% of those who use it, track ROI

* Becoming 'centralized' thorugh influencer marketing agencies 
  * Interesting incentive problems here...

* Large growth in the use of "micro" influencers 

* Growing concern: compliance issues
  * Only approx 20% of (US/UK) posts meet regulatory guidelines

# Identifying Influential and Susceptible Members of Social Networks

---
class: font160
# Influence and Susceptibility

**Motivation**: How does behavior spread through a social network?

**Specific Questions**:

* Who is susceptible to influence?
* Who can be influential?

**How?**: Randomized experiment on Facebook

---
class: font160
# The Experiment

* Sample: representative sample of 1.3 million users

* Treatment: Manipulation of influence-mediating messages (about films)
  * If "user A" adopted an app allowing info/opinion sharing ...
  * ... random selection of friends where notified ...
  * ... and got a link to adopt the application  

* Outcome variable: Time to peer adoption
  * $\implies$ estimate a hazard model 
  * Hazard ratio > 1 increased susceptiblity / influence

**Note: The design is nice...**

# Results: Influence and Susceptibility

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/aral_fig_01.png")
```

class: font140
# Takeaways?

**Most susceptible to influence:**

* Younger people (0-18)
* Men
* People who are engaged

**More influential:**

* Men 
* Older
* Married

**Question: Are these variables capturing something unobserved?**

I think the answer is yes... 

* These groups feel artificial, and likely capturing something related to interests

# Social Media, Influencers, and Adoption

**Motivation**: Quantifying the effect of influencers (and social media) on product adoption

**Specific Questions**:

* Do influencers facilitate product adoption? When?
* What's the mechanism through which it happens?

**How?**: Randomized Control Trial in rural China

---
class: font160
# The Experiment

* Product: nano-pesticide

* Sample: approx 700 farmers across 34 villages

* Two Treatments: 
  * Online discussion group on WeChat per village 
  * Add eminent local personalities 
    * "peer encouragment design"

* Outcome variables:
  * Farmers trial a product
  * Adoption

# The Experiment as a Graph

# Influencers & Interactions


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/zhang_influence_volume.png")
```

.center[Influencers lead to more discussion in online discussion platform]

---
# Trial and Adoption

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/zhang_did.png")
```

**Findings**

* Influencers $\rightarrow$ early trial
* Influencers and one-on-one support $\rightarrow$ similar adoption rates
  * Big cost difference!

**Mechanisms?**

* Encouragement to try the product 
  * Building trust + eliminating uncertainty about product and company

# Recap

class: font160
# Recap

* Influencer market is large, mostly 'unregulated' 

* Hard to generally classify people as susceptible to influencers or organically 'likely' influential 

* Influencers lead to increased early adoption & can be generate good ROI 

* Growing push for regulation $\rightarrow$ consumer's engagement with influencers decreases
